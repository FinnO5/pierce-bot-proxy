# pierce-bot-proxy
A Discord bot system that lets users send and receive messages in servers through the botâ€™s identity using a custom web UI â€” perfect for when you canâ€™t use your own account directly.

I did in fact use chat gpt in the making of this, and right before I uploaded I asked it to just go through make clean up my comments, but not chnage any fucntinality. The proccess I go through is me driven, the ai is like a unpaid intern working for me(ðŸ˜¿). Its definetly better at me at some things, but ultimatly I need to be leading and doing to bulk of th work. At least that is the way that it is sattfiitying for me ðŸ¤·.

Purpose
____________________
This system is designed primarily for teens who want to use Discord, but whose parents have restrictions on their phone, computer, or internet access. It allows you to use Discord without having the official app installed and without being logged in directly.

The project is meant to appear harmless and secure from a parent's perspectiveâ€”especially if they're not particularly tech-savvy. When you open the index page, you'll see a simple set of buttons. Entering the correct password unlocks the actual Discord-like interface.

You can run this server on something like a Raspberry Pi and hide the device somewhere out of sight (like in a closet). When you're ready, just connect to it from your phone. If you need to hide the interface quickly, clicking one of the password buttons will hide the UI and return to the basic button page.

Even in your browser history, it will just show localhost or a local network address, and if a parent visits it, they'll only see the basic button screenâ€”not the actual chat UI.

But ultimatly i can see many uses for it.


IT DOESNâ€™T WORK! (set up)

2. **Make a Discord developer account**, add a new application, and make sure it has a bot.  

3. Go to the **Installation** tab in the application page and change the default install settings:  
   - **Scopes**: `application.commands`, `bot`  
   - **Permissions**: `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`  

4. Copy the generated install link and use it to add your bot to whichever server you want.  

5. Go to the **Bot** tab and copy the bot token.  

6. put your new bot token in the .env file in the program directory
